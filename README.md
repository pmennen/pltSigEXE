# pltSigEXE
pltSig was originally written as a collection of signal processing applications for users of the Matlab language.

However I found that there was a strong demand for one of the applications in this collection
(called erip, for equal ripple filter design) even among non-Matlab users. The reason for this
is that the alternatives available for digital filter design are far less capable than erip and
also are generally expensive. In contrast, pltSig.exe (which includes erip) is free. Although
erip is the most popular applicaiton in the pltSig collection, it also includes quite a few
other signal processing applications as well as applications in other mathematical and
engineering topics that you may find useful and interesting.

No source code is included in this repository, however the complete source code is available.
To find the source code, search for "pltSig" at the Matlab File Exchange, and download that toolbox.

Although you must have a Matlab license to run the pltSig toolbox, I used a Maltab compiler to
convert the pltSig Matlab code to a windows executable file that can be run on any version of
windows from WinXP up to Windows 11. A Matlab license is not required to run pltSig.exe.

To run pltSig.exe follow these steps:
- Create a new folder called pltSig in any convenient location in your windows file system.
- Download pltSigEXE.zip from this GitHub repository: <url>
- Unzip the zip file to the new folder you just created. You will now see the files pltSig.exe and erip.exe in the new folder.
- Create a desktop icon for pltSig.exe by dragging the pltSig.exe file to your desktop with the right mouse button.
- Then select "Create shortcuts here".
- Similarly, create a desktop icon for erip.exe by dragging the erip.exe file to your desktop.

If you prefer less clutter on your desktop, you don't really need the icon for erip.exe since
you can start erip from the pltSig.exe icon by clicking on a single button. Converserly if you
find that erip is the only application included with pltSig that you are interested in, then
you can delete the icon for pltSig.exe and start erip using its dedicated icon.
